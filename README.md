## Usage

To begin the program, type "node app.js" into your terminal. If it has properly booted up, a question asking what type of employee you are will appear in your terminal. Follow the prompts from there. Once you have input all employee information, then answer "no" to "Do you want to add another employee?" and your team profile will be generated under the file name "index.html".
